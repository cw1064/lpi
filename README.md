In this directory you will find:

/gv 		- the 5 original gv files used to generate the graphs in the report  
/svgpre		- the 5 svg files generated by graphviz using the gv files  
/svgpost	- the 5 svg files generated by my algorithm using the prior svg files  
lpi.py		- my algorithm  
two ttfs	- required for function of algorithm  
this file	- hi!  

To generate the svgpre files, I used graphviz in the command line as follows  
`dot -Tsvg x.gv -o xpre.svg`  
With x replaced with the number of the file

To generate the svgpost files, I used my algorithm in the command line in the following way  
`lpi.py xpre.svg xpost.svg`  
again, with x replaced with the number of the file

It can also be used generically as follows  
`lpi.py <input> <output>`

My algorithm requires that any fonts used in the file are also in the directory with the algorithm.
It also requires Pillow be installed (I installed this with pip but you can use whatever you wish)
It uses ElementTree too but I think that's preinstalled in python? I certainly don't remember installing it and I can't find it in pip's list
